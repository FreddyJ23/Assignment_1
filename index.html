                <blockquote>
                    ...to learn and not to do is really not to learn. To know and not to do is really not to know.

                <h2>Reasons for Joining Altschool</h2>
                <p>As many might know, the obvious reason why most people get into tech nowadays is to get a job and earn money but mine is more than that. Don't get me wrong, i'm also in for the money, i mean who isn't? but I have a thing for problem solving and that is mostly why i got into tech. I believe altschool is the perfect platform for me that will help me transition into this journey.</p>
